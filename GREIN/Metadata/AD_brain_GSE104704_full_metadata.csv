A neuropathological diagnosis of AD was established based on the presence of plaques and tangles using the CERAD scores and Braak stages, respectively.  All selected AD cases had high level of AD neuropathological changes (Braak=V/VI and CERAD=C). The Young and Old control brains had no or minimal neuritic amyloid plaques (CERAD=0) or neurofibrillary tangles (CERAD=0). None of the AD cases had other coincident neurodegenerative diseases. Control subjects had no deposits consistent with a frontotemporal lobar degeneration or Lewy body related pathology diagnosis. AD cases with severe neuronal loss were not included. The neuronal loss was originally assessed through semi-quantitative measurements by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining by board-certified neuropathologists of the CNDR.

Purified RNA was subsequently treated with RNase-free DNase (Qiagen).,"RNA sequencing libraries were prepared as previously described with a few changes, such as omission of the polyA+ selection step and addition of a double-stranded nuclease (DSN)-mediated step to deplete highly abundant RNA species, such as ribosomal RNA. Briefly, purified RNA was fragmented using RNA Fragmentation Reagent (Thermo Fisher) for 5 min at 70°C and followed by addition of a 5’ phosphate by treating with T4 polynucleotide kinase (NEB). The RNA fragments were then size-selected to 60-250 bp on a 15% TBE-urea gel. Illumina v1.5 RNA adapters were ligated to the 3’ and 5’ ends of the fragmented products using T4 RNA ligase 2, truncated (NEB) and T4 RNA ligase (Promega), respectively. cDNA libraries were generated using Superscript II (Invitrogen) and PCR-amplified using Phusion high-fidelity DNA polymerase (NEB). Libraries were purified on a 6% TBE gel (Invitrogen), treated with DSN and PCR re-amplified. Quality of the resulting sequencing libraries were verified by cloning into Zero Blunt TOPO (Invitrogen) and analyzing 6-10 clones by standard Sanger sequencing to determine the presence of adapters, appropriate size selection, abundance of ribosomal RNA, and the diversity of the library products. The libraries were pooled and sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 500 using the standard protocols for 75 bp single-read sequencing.",9606,Alignment: RNA-seq tags were aligned to the human reference genome (assembly  NCBI37/hg19) using Tophat.,"Quantitation: RNA-seq tags were quantified over exons with the HTSeq-count script. For genes that give rise to multiple transcripts, a single representative was chosen for the analysis.",Differential Expression: Differential expression was analyzed at the level of RefSeq transcripts using DESeq in the R statistical environment (www.r-project.org).,Genome_build: hg19,"Supplementary_files_format_and_content: Table contains DESeq library size-adjusted tag counts for each gene in each sample plus a pairwise statistical assessment of differential expression in Young:Old, Old:AD, and Young:AD (adjusted to correct for false discovery rate).",GPL18573,"Gregory,,Donahue",Zaret Lab,Cell & Developmental Biology,The University of Pennsylvania,"3400 Civic Center Blvd, Bldg 421",Philadelphia,PA,19104,USA,0,Illumina NextSeq 500,cDNA,transcriptomic,RNA-Seq,BioSample: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/biosample/SAMN07757234,SRA: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRX3257535,NONE,SRR6145444,2018-03-08 00:04:46,2017-10-06 15:20:30,39847390,2946541065,0,73,1259,https://sra-download.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/traces/sra52/SRR/006001/SRR6145444,SRX3257535,RNA-Seq,cDNA,TRANSCRIPTOMIC,SINGLE,0,0,ILLUMINA,NextSeq 500,SRP119561,PRJNA413568,2,413568,SRS2570995,SAMN07757234,simple,9606,Homo sapiens,no,GEO,SRA617775,public,97CD015010808F58DABA8268EB436F8B,B7D275CE68251696682B31515DE80447
