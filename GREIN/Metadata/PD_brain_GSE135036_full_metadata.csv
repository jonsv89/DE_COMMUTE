Individually indexed libraries were pooled and 75 bp, single end sequencing was performed on an Illumina NextSeq 500 sequencer using a 75 bp HO sequencing kit (v2) (Illumina Inc.), with all libraries run across 4 flowcells to return a minimum read depth of 40M read pairs per library.  Base calling was done by Illumina NextSeq Control Software (NCS) v2.0 and output of NCS was demultiplexed and converted to FastQ format with Illumina Bcl2fastq v1.9.0.",9606,Trim Galore was used to trim the 75bp single-end reads prior to genome alignment,STAR index was generated using Ensemble GRCh37.p13 primary assembly genome and the Gencode v19 primary assembly annotation,Read alignment and gene counts were performed using STAR,Gene count matrix was imported into R (v3.4.1) and low expressed genes (counts per million < 1 in more than 30% of samples) were removed prior to trimmed mean of M-values normalization in EdgeR,The limma statistical package19 was used to transform the count matrix to log2-counts per million and fit a robust linear model,Genome_build: hg19,"Supplementary_files_format_and_content: Each ReadsPerGene.out.tab file contain the following information in order: gene ID, counts for unstranded RNA-seq, counts for the 1st read strand aligned with RNA, counts for the 2nd read strand aligned with RNA",GPL18573,"Peipei,,Li",peipei.li@vai.org,6162345547,Labrie lab,Center for Neurodegenerative Science,Van Andel Research Institute,333 Bostwick Ave N.E.,Grand Rapids,MI,49503,USA,0,Illumina NextSeq 500,cDNA,transcriptomic,RNA-Seq,BioSample: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/biosample/SAMN12390716,SRA: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRX6608920,ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM3984nnn/GSM3984186/suppl/GSM3984186_HctZZJ006_L000_R1_001ReadsPerGene.out.tab.gz,SRR9854911,2020-02-20 21:56:52,2019-07-29 13:33:57,14372790,1092332040,0,76,384,https://sra-download.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/traces/sra46/SRR/009623/SRR9854911,SRX6608920,RNA-Seq,cDNA,TRANSCRIPTOMIC,SINGLE,0,0,ILLUMINA,NextSeq 500,SRP216705,PRJNA557205,3,557205,SRS5173164,SAMN12390716,simple,9606,Homo sapiens,no,GEO,SRA928277,public,557B1044A75BAB48EF0940D7A6A47450,8E6A78582FBFDC3013DF09BC850C1AE4
