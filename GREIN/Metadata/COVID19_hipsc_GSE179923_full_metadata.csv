After 24 hours cells were harvested and total RNA was extracted according to the manufacturer’s instructions using the NucleoSpin® RNA Kit (#740955.250, Macherey-Nagel). RNA concentration and quality was determined using a NanoDrop™ 1000 Spectrophotometer (ThermoFisher Scientific) and samples were stored at -80 °C until further use.","The hiPSC line WISCi004-B/IMR90-4 was used to differentiate BCECs. a single cell suspension of hiPSCs was prepared with Accutase. The cell suspension was centrifuged at 300 x g for 5 min and cells were seeded in mTeSRTM1 supplemented with 10 µM Y-27632 onto Matrigel-coated 6-well plates. The seeding density was optimized for each hiPSC line. For the differentiation of hiPSCs to BCECs, the neurodevelopmental process in vivo has to be recapitulated in vitro. For brain-capillary endothelial-like cells, a co-differentiation of neural and endothelial cells was initiated by treatment with so-called unconditioned medium. After 2-3 days when optimal cell densities of 2-4x104 cells/cm2 were reached, medium was switched to unconditioned medium in order to initiate co-differentiation of BCECs and neuronal cells (referred to as day 0 of differentiation throughout the manuscript). Unconditioned medium was composed of 78.5% DMEM/F12 , 20% KnockOutTM serum replacement, 1% MEM NEAA, 0.5% L-glutamine, and 0.1 mM β-mercaptoethanol. A daily change of unconditioned medium for 5 days was followed by double feeding at day 6 with endothelial cell (EC) medium supplemented with 20 ng/ml hbFGF  and 10 µM retinoic acid to expand the BCECs. EC medium was composed of Human Endothelial-SFM and, if not stated otherwise, 0.5% B27 Supplement as described recently (Neal et al., 2019).

After 24 hours cells were harvested and total RNA was extracted according to the manufacturer’s instructions using the NucleoSpin® RNA Kit (#740955.250, Macherey-Nagel). RNA concentration and quality was determined using a NanoDrop™ 1000 Spectrophotometer (ThermoFisher Scientific) and samples were stored at -80 °C until further use.","The hiPSC line WISCi004-B/IMR90-4 was used to differentiate BCECs. a single cell suspension of hiPSCs was prepared with Accutase. The cell suspension was centrifuged at 300 x g for 5 min and cells were seeded in mTeSRTM1 supplemented with 10 µM Y-27632 onto Matrigel-coated 6-well plates. The seeding density was optimized for each hiPSC line. For the differentiation of hiPSCs to BCECs, the neurodevelopmental process in vivo has to be recapitulated in vitro. For brain-capillary endothelial-like cells, a co-differentiation of neural and endothelial cells was initiated by treatment with so-called unconditioned medium. After 2-3 days when optimal cell densities of 2-4x104 cells/cm2 were reached, medium was switched to unconditioned medium in order to initiate co-differentiation of BCECs and neuronal cells (referred to as day 0 of differentiation throughout the manuscript). Unconditioned medium was composed of 78.5% DMEM/F12 , 20% KnockOutTM serum replacement, 1% MEM NEAA, 0.5% L-glutamine, and 0.1 mM β-mercaptoethanol. A daily change of unconditioned medium for 5 days was followed by double feeding at day 6 with endothelial cell (EC) medium supplemented with 20 ng/ml hbFGF  and 10 µM retinoic acid to expand the BCECs. EC medium was composed of Human Endothelial-SFM and, if not stated otherwise, 0.5% B27 Supplement as described recently (Neal et al., 2019). After 48 h without medium change, cells were dissociated with Accutase for 30 min and seeded at a cell density of 1x106 cells/cm2 onto collagen IV/fibronectin-coated transwell insert in EC medium supplemented with 20 ng/mL hFGF and 10 µM RA.
